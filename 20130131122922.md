## Backend

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   None in this release.

### Fixes

*   The "Sort" button on the group members list page is now properly enabled on
    page load. This prevented members from being sorted.
*   The option to setup an automatic/recurring donation is no longer displayed
    when the site is using PayPal Standard, which does not allow such payments.
*   Deleting sites with a large number of log records no longer fails due to too
    much memory usage.

## API

### Additions

*   Added `event_title_show_time` parameter to the
    [event display:calendar API](http://developers.monkcms.com/article/events-api/#calendar)
    for displaying the start time with the event title.

### Changes

*   None in this release.

### Fixes

*   Sermon video tags now correctly use specified parameters.
*   Updating a rotator now correctly clears the client cache when `find` is used
    with a page identifier (i.e., `p-1234`) in a
    [rotator display:slides API](http://developers.monkcms.com/article/rotators-api/#slides)
    call.
*   Download URLs (for media like sermon audio, video, etc.) now work when
    there's a `+` in the URL.
*   Requests by non-existent sites now fail quickly and gracefully.
