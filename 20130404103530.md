Released on 4/4/2013 at 3:39 AM PST.

## Backend

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   When a site is deleted, the media files are no longer deleted from the
    site/media host, since the host has likely already been removed.
*   The old bulk media importer — slated to be removed on April 3 — will now
    be removed on April 15.

### Fixes

*   DRM media files are once again flagged as such, and no longer transferred
    to the site/media host.
*   Fixed the ability to add a donation to an order (such as an RSVP).
*   Certain long-running jobs — like transferring large media files — should now
    be marked as completed more reliably.
*   When a single feed is queued for building, the associated site is now set
    for display on the Queue list page.
