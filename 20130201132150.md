## Backend

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   Search results on list pages are now ordered by weight of the match. That
    is, if one result is a more accurate match than another, it will be listed
    higher on the list. Certain fields are also weighted more than others, such
    as the title/name of a record.
*   Reduced the amount of time waiting between last key pressed in the search
    field and execution of the search. This should result is slightly faster
    searches.

### Fixes

*   Filters on list pages no longer reset the list order or number of records
    per page to the default.
