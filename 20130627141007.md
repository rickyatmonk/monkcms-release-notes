## Backend

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   Sales export data no longer includes card type, since that's not always
    stored.

### Fixes

*   The client cache is now cleared after a media file is overwritten. This
    prevents old, broken URLs from being cached in content.
*   Event RSVP details are now displayed more accurately when viewing a sale.
*   Media file names should no longer include duplicate identifiers (i.e.,
    `0e1135557_1316528770_0e1135557_...`).

## API

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   None in this release.

### Fixes

*   Media image URLs are once again correctly replaced with `monkimage.php` URLs
    when the `<img>` tag has `width` and `height` attributes. This causes images
    to be cached on the client at the specified size, rather than loading
    full-size versions.
*   Commenting is now more secure and stable.
