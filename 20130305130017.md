## Backend

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   Deleting a media record now queues the various file formats to be deleted
    from the site's media and backup hosts.
*   Deleting a feed now queues the file to be deleted from the site's host.
*   Updated the WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE) to the latest version.

### Fixes

*   International locations no longer display the "region" (in the US, this is
    the state) if it's a numeric identifier.
*   The queue processes that transfer and encode media now handle exceptions
    more reliably, such as the file no longer existing.
*   Fixed a very rare issue that caused site creation to fail if another site
    was created at the exact same moment.
