## Backend

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   Media files with a `.bmp` extension are no longer categorized as images, as
    most image functionality (such as the image API) doesn't support them.

### Fixes

*   For sites with an SFTP media host, empty files are no longer left in the
    media directory in certain circumstances when the transfer fails.
*   When a site is converted to BYOS, the Flash format of videos is no longer
    re-encoded or deleted from the site's media directory. Such files are simply
    transferred to the new directory structure.
*   Numerous fixes for BYOS-enabled sites that make transferring and encoding
    media more reliable.

## API

### Additions

*   Added `__timezone__` and `__timezoneoffset__` tags to the
    [site display:detail API](http://developers.monkcms.com/article/site-api/#detail).

### Changes

*   None in this release.

### Fixes

*   Monklet cache directories that contain date-sensitive content (such as
    events) are now created more reliably.
