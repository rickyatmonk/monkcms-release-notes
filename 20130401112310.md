## Backend

### Additions

*   Added a dedicated button to the WYSIWYG editor for uploading media files.
    This was previously only accessible from within the Image Manager (see
    below).

### Changes

*   Removed the Image Manager from the WYSIWYG editor, as it depended on media
    files being stored on the local server, which will soon be replaced by
    storage in The Cloud (Rackspace Cloud Files & Amazon S3).
*   Increased the media file size limit to 1 GB per file.

### Fixes

*   The latest date of an series' article or sermon is now correctly set during
    a site copy.
*   Removing all articles or sermons from a series now correctly clears the
    latest date of the series.

## API

### Additions

*   Added a `__slug__` tag to the [galleries display:detail API](http://developers.monkcms.com/article/galleries-api/#detail)
    for `before_show_gallery` and `after_show_gallery`, as well as a
    `__galleryslug__` tag for `show_gallery`.

### Changes

*   None in this release.

### Fixes

*   When grouping the [sermons display:list API](http://developers.monkcms.com/article/sermons-api/#list)
    by `groupby:year`, the `__slug__` tag is now set correctly for `group_show`.
