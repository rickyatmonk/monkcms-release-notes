## Backend

### Additions

*   The job queue list page (reseller-only) can now be filtered by "Queue" and
    "Status".
*   Resellers now have access to the FTP queue list page from the footer,
    instead of only displaying the number of items in the queue.
*   Resellers now have access to the "Full Link" to a page from the footer,
    which includes the current site ID so that resellers don't have to manually
    switch sites before trying to access the content.

### Changes

*   None in this release.

### Fixes

*   XML files generated by flash galleries are now compatible with BYOS-enabled
    sites.
