## Backend

### Additions

*   Sermons and articles can now be added/removed from series and categories en
    masse from their respective list pages.

### Changes

*   Searching on list pages now uses the same full-text search service that
    powers the global spotlight search and API search. Now, instead of only
    select data being searchable, almost all data associated with the content
    can be matched.

### Fixes

*   Changes to forms now clears pages from the client cache since forms can be
    embedded in pages.

## API

### Additions

*   The search display:results API now accepts
    [an `offset` parameter](http://developers.monkcms.com/article/search-api/#result-parameter).

### Changes

*   None in this release.

### Fixes

*   Linked content in the WYSIWYG editor that no longer exists now links to the
    home page (`/`) instead of returning a broken anchor tag.
*   Video custom fields now correctly return the embeddable `<iframe>` HTML if
    it's an embedded video (i.e., YouTube, Vimeo).
