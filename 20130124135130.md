## Backend

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   List pages now load up to 4x faster! As part of an effort to reduce load
    time across the system, list pages no longer require three separate ajax
    requests. All of the data is now loaded in the initial page request, which
    greatly reduces the amount of time to display the full page.

### Fixes

*   The WYSIWYG editor now matches [youtu.be](http://youtu.be) URLs more
    consistently.
*   On the members list page, the "Rule" filter now works when "ALL MODULES" is
    selected.

## API

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   None in this release.

### Fixes

*   Arguments on the `__photourl__` tag in the members API now work when used in
    monklets.
