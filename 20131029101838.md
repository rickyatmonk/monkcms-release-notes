## Backend

### Additions

*   Added documents back to the WYSIWYG editor's link list.

### Changes

*   Upgraded the WYSIWYG editor to the latest version.
*   Podcast feeds now display each sermon or article's image in iTunes.

### Fixes

*   The WYSIWYG editor now loads more consistently in IE 10. It would sometimes
    fail to load and leave the native textarea containing the HTML.
*   Record locking now works for records without a site-specific ID, such as the
    default sermon feed.
