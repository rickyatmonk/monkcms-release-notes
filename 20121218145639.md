## Backend

### Additions

*   There's a new section for site administrators when editing their site
    settings: Custom CSS! This allows a site to add custom CSS without needing
    FTP access or messing with code editors. See below for the subsequent API
    additions.

### Changes

*   When editing a link list, the input field and submit button to change the
    name of the link list is now hidden to prevent confusion when editing and
    saving a specific link. There is now an "Edit Name" link that displays the
    input field and submit button on click.
*   On the event list page, the link to view RSVPs for an event is now displayed
    regardless of whether registration is currently disabled.

### Fixes

*   Recurring events with exceptions can now be deleted without throwing an
    error.
*   Editing a link list now properly locks the record from being edited by other
    users.

## API

### Additions

*   Custom CSS (see backend additions above) can be output through
    [a new site display:css API](http://developers.monkcms.com/article/site-api/#css).

### Changes

*   Sermons and articles now return a max of 500 records if no limit is
    specified.

### Fixes

*   In monkcms.php, clearing the events cache no longer causes an infinite loop
    in certain fringe cases.
