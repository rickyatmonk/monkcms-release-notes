# Backend

## Additions

*   None in this release.

## Changes

*   The global "Easy Edit" link in the top navigation — which opens the site
    with Easy Edit mode enabled — now opens in a new window.
*   When adding a new blog post, the submit button now reads "Save" instead of
    "Post", which was deceiving because it didn't actually post the blog post
    (that happens on the following Publish page). For consistency, the "Done"
    submit button when editing a blog post has been removed in favor of "Save"
    as well.

## Fixes

*   None in this release.
