### Fixes

*   Cached monklets that contain event calls are now cleared out each day to
    prevent stale content. Bumped `monkcms.php` version to 7.4.
*   `monkcms.js` and `monkcms-dev.js` now use jQuery's `$(document).ready()`
    instead of `window.onload` for executing code on page load. This prevents
    conflict with other libraries that use `window.onload`.
