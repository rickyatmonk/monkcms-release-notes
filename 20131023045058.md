## Backend

### Additions

*   Added a visual file selector with thumbnail previews when inserting an
    image, video, or link to a media file in the WYSIWYG editor.

### Changes

*   Upgraded the WYSIWYG editor to the latest version, which includes a
    completely revamped interface and feature set.
*   Media files can now be uploaded in bulk (with drag-and-drop support) through
    the WYSIWYG editor.
*   The `editor.css` file for styling content in the WYSIWYG editor can now be
    located at `/_assets/css/editor.css` or `/_css/editor.css`, in addition to
    the previous media folder location.

### Fixes

*   Publishing one or more events from the list page no longer throws an error
    if none belong to a group.
*   Making a media change to a sermon that no longer exists now shows an
    error stating as much, instead of showing the generic error page.
*   Adding or editing an event occurrence no longer throws an error in certain
    contexts.

### Changes

### Fixes

    of throwing an error.
