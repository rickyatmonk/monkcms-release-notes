## Backend

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   Overwriting an existing media file has been simplified. Instead of
    redirecting the user to a separate page to decide whether to overwrite the
    existing file or create a new file, the user is asked as they're uploading
    the new file.
*   The uniqueness of media names is now enforced.
*   Overwriting an existing media file now causes the file name to change.
*   When overwriting an existing media file, monklets are now included in the
    search and replace of the old file name with the new file name.

### Fixes

*   The job queue list page (reseller-only) no longer displays some jobs with a
    blank site.
*   After uploading a media file through the WYSIWYG editor, the success or
    failure image is no longer broken.
