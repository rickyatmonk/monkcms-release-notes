## Backend

### Additions

*   Introducing events feeds! Just as you can create RSS feeds for sermons,
    articles, and blogs, you can now also create ICS feeds for events. More
    details over at the [feeds overview](http://developers.monkcms.com/article/feeds-overview/)
    page.

### Changes

*   None in this release.

### Fixes

*   On the rare occassion that two members edit a record at the exact same
    moment, an error is no longer displayed to the member who is locked out.
*   Fixed a bug that caused digital product download links to be displayed
    incorrectly on the order detail page for members.
*   The "Category" selector on the donation checkout page is now properly saved
    in all contexts.

## API

### Additions

*   None in this release.

### Changes

*   Requests for non-existent .pdf and .ics files on client sites now return a
    straight 404 error instead of redirecting to the site's error page. This
    change will slowly roll out to sites over time.
*   Media downloads through the `download.php` script are now rate limited by
    IP address to prevent abuse (primarily by bots). A single IP address cannot
    download the same file more than 5 times in 5 minutes, or more than 20
    different files in the same period.

### Fixes

*   When the `request` parameter of the [forms API](http://developers.monkcms.com/article/forms-overview/)
    is set to `json`, the correct content type header is sent with the response.
    Additionally, JSONP is now supported if a `callback` parameter is sent with
    the request.
